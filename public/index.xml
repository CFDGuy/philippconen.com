      <description>On this channel, you can find posts about my projects regarding Computational-Fluid-Dynamics (CFD). I prefer to perform in OpenFOAM (OF) because it&amp;rsquo;s powerful and open source. I am also familiar with ANSYS Fluent and some basic Matlab-Solver.
&amp;ldquo;In my eyes Fluid-Dynamics especially CFD is the perfect momentum where physics and engineering come together. The flow of fluids is a matter which is fascinating me most.&amp;rdquo;
My future projects are:
 Analyse the airflow in a gym according to the covid-19 pandemic Analyse the impact of an increasing amount of cores during parallel simulation Extend the analyzes on the investigation of the compressible flow of real gases around a circular cylinder with Novec 649 by considering different Mach numbers Push forward troubleshooting and teaching OpenFOAM in form of a small book  ~</description>

      <description>I am glad to welcome you on my website and hope you can orient as fast as possible. As a good college of mine showed me the hugh advantage of open source and mind sharing I also would like to share information and ideas to make the world better just a little. On this site you can find my projects in many different areas. These areas contribute to:
 Computational-Fluid-Dynamics (CFD), Hardware-projects and Software-projects  As I am nativ german, this side is not only performing in englisch.</description>

      <description>Again a warm welcome to my website! My name is Philipp and I am a graduated bachelor mechanical engineer and a master computational engineering student. After secondary school, I started working as a precision mechanic with an apprenticeship at Münster University of Applied Sciences. Getting expertise in four years of crafting test benches, mechanical products, and maintaining machines I decided to go on learning. So I started signing in to get the high school diploma and ended up as a student at Münster University of Applied Sciences.</description>

      <title>The &#34;figure&#34; Shortcode</title>

      <description>Hugo has figure shortcode built in, so you can easily add figcaptions or hyperlink rel attributes to images. Documentations can be found here:
https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure
This theme has 3 CSS classes made for figure elements:
 big: images will break the width limit of main content area. left: images will float to the left. right: images will float to the right.  If a figure has no class set, the image will behave just like a normal markdown image: !</description>

      <description>Just define the image URL in the content’s front matter, the featured image will be displayed as the background.
For example:
---images:- https://picsum.photos/1024/768/?random---This is an array, you can set multiple urls, only the first url will be used. These images is also used in Twitter Cards and the Open Graph metadata.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>
